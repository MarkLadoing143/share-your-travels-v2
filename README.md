University Web Assignment I built with a partner of an image gallery featuring photographs, posts, and location information which have their data stored in a MySQL database and retrieved using PHP. 

## Description

Originally developed with [Dan Dobranski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-dobranski-07909383/) as the second phase/assignment of a semester-long web development project for COMP 3512 - Web II: Web Application Development, expanding upon code developed in Assignment 1. 

This second version includes additional functions such as the ability to favorite images and users posts, as well as a shopping cart to purchase images with various customizable features including image size, stock, frame style, and choice of shipping method. Favorites and Cart data are stored via PHP session variables. This version also utilizes PHP classes to retrieve and display data from the MySQL Database.
