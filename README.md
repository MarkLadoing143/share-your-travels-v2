Originally developed with [Dan Dobranski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-dobranski-07909383/) in December 2015 as the second phase/assignment of a semester-long web development project for COMP 3512 - Web II: Web Application Development. 

First phase/assignment was originally completed individually, whereas this one was completed with a partner/team, to which Dan's assignment was used as the basis for this second version.

## Description

Developed using PHP and MySQL and expanding upon code developed in Assignment 1, this second version includes additional functions such as the ability to favorite images and users posts, as well as a shopping cart to purchase images with various customizable features including image size, stock, frame style, and choice of shipping method. Favorites and Cart data are stored via PHP session variables. 

This version also utilizes PHP classes instead of prepared statements to retrieve and display data from the MySQL Database in a object-oriented fashion.
